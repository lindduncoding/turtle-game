# Simple Turtle Game

Turtle is a vector graphics library built in the Python programming language. It can be used to make fun little games as well, like this simple maze game. Suitable for teaching basic programming logic to the public with little to no IT experience. 

## How It Works

1. Initialize the Turtle and the Screen
2. Define Turtle's movement
3. Screen will listen for key press events
4. Key press events will trigger Turtle's movement defined earlier
5. Import a random Maze picture

Turtle can still move "above the walls" because the Maze grid is just a static background but it's a good and simple enough start.
